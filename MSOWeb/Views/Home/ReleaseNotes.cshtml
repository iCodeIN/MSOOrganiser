<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>Several of the live results pages were overhauled during MSO 2018 to be 
    optimised for a wide screen display, as well as being embedded in 
    msoworld.com</p>

<p>Since MSO 2018</p>

<ul>
<li>21/10/18 Women who choose not to enter the Women's Pentamind now handled by
    database entries, not hard-coding</li>
<li>21/10/18 Database purged of late fees, observer tickets and other non-event
    "entries" from 1997-2003. The requirement for Events to have a four-letter
    code matching the relevant Game has been removed (although we will keep it
    as a convention)</li>
<li>14/10/18 Release notes added</li>
</ul>
