<h3>Useful information</h3>

        <li>To add or change the events they are entered into, press <i>Add/Remove Events</i>. A popup box will 
            open where you can check the events the competitor wishes to enter. Note that you cannot remove an
            event which they have already taken part in. Press <i>OK</i> when done or <i>Cancel</i> to start over.</li>
        <li>If there are any event clashes, the popup will warn you when you OK it.</li>

        <li>Ensure you have the correct event selected from the dropdown.</li>
        <li>Ensure you have the correct rules for the event set up - i.e. whether the aim is to get a high
            score or a low score.</li>
        <li>For each competitor, enter their <b>Score</b> and <b>Tie Break</b> from the event scorecards.</li>
        <li>If someone is listed but did not take part, check the <b>Absent</b> box.</li>

        <li>Next, assign medals and Junior medals as appropriate. Juniors are indicated by the label JNR next to

        <li>Once done, press <i>Save</i>. If you make a mistake and wish to start over, press <i>Cancel</i>.</li>
        <li>On saving, the application will automatically calculate Ranks and Pentamind Points. You can do these
